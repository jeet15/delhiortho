                            <p>Dear Friends,<br>
                                Greetings!<br>
                            Wanted to share a few thoughts based on my recent experience with Covid.</p>
                            <p>Had tested positive on 24th of April,& probably contacted from my wife (though she tested -ve on 2 occasions,but had all the symptoms), Who is HOD Neonatology at RML.</p>
                            <p>I shifted to YMCA (a Covid care centre) on 27th and stayed there till 13th May(  discharged after testing negative.) Letâ€™s be realistic,most of us are going to contact the bug sooner or later. So my two bits worth,in case u get it</p>			
							<ul>
								<li>stay positive (I mean mentally)& happy.Learn to live with it.</li>
								<li>stay informed.</li>
								<li>if you test positive,be prepared for society to ostracize you(strange but true)</li>
								<li>home isolation is best (unless symptoms are severe or there are elderly family members at home)</li>
								<li>most of us will sail through smoothly </li>
								<li>but as ortho surgeons we anyway go in with a backup plan B & C(if we plan a PFN,we keep a DHS and proximal femoral plate handy)</li>
								<li>if u go into isolation stay constantly connected to friends and family ( in my 18 days in a CCC I would get 50-100 calls a day to pep me up</li>
								<li>work on your fitness especially lung function.<li>
								<li>if you have co-morbidiy,control it</li>
								<li>be in touch with a sensible physician</li>
								<li>NO Smoking</li>
								<li>use your time constructively (u May never get such a chance to be with yourself again)</li>
								
							</ul>
							
                            <p>Hoping you all stay safe and are able to avoid the bug</p>
                            <p>(Of course if the need arises feel free to call me any time)
</p>
							<p></p>
